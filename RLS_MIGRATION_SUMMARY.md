## Tables Not Modified (Public Display Content)

### panels ⚠️

**Note:** Modifications properly restricted to admins/operators

### media ⚠️
**Current:** Anyone can view active media (TVs need to see them)
**Reason:** Display screens need unauthenticated access
**Note:** Modifications properly restricted to admins/operators

## Migration Impact

- **7 tables** had their policies updated to require authentication
- **4 tables** were already properly secured
- **2 tables** (panels, media) remain publicly viewable for TV display functionality
- **All configuration tables** now require authentication for viewing
- **All configuration tables** require admin role for modifications

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This migration introduces breaking changes for any unauthenticated clients accessing the following tables:
- check_ins
- calls
- activity_logs (viewing)
- check_in_config (viewing)
- panel_config (viewing)
- custom_fields (viewing)
- panel_layouts (viewing)

**Required Actions:**
1. Ensure all API clients pass authentication tokens
2. Update any webhook integrations to use authenticated service accounts
3. Update TV display applications if they access configuration tables
4. Test all integrations after deployment

## Security Benefits

✅ All sensitive data now requires authentication
✅ Configuration tables protected from unauthorized access
✅ Admin-only modifications properly enforced
✅ Activity logs secured from tampering
✅ Lead and check-in data protected
✅ Webhook configurations secured
